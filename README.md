# Cryptographic-performance-analysis


The task was to compare the required time of three different cryptographic algorithms (DES, RSA, Sha512) using three different sized files. Please checkout the [report](https://github.com/anik-chy/Cryptographic-Performance-analysis/blob/main/CryptographyPerformance.pdf) for the complete workflow.

## Required package
- [PyCryptodome](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Thanks
I want to thank Mr. Saket Upadhyay. Without his [experiment](https://github.com/Saket-Upadhyay/RSA-Large-File-Efficiency-Compare) I couldn't complete the RSA part.
